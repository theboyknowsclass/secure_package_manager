# Implementation Plan: Package Lock Upload

**Branch**: `001-package-lock-upload` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-package-lock-upload/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-package-lock-upload/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Enable secure package-lock.json file uploads through a web interface with ADFS authentication. Users can upload files up to 100MB, with validation, progress tracking, and proper error handling. The system stores raw file content, requestor information, and metadata for background processing. Enhanced with modern React, Vite, Storybook, MSW, and automated accessibility testing.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (backend), TypeScript 5.0+ (frontend), React 19.1.1, Node.js 20.x LTS  
**Primary Dependencies**: Flask 3.1.2, React 19.1.1, Vite 5.0+, Material-UI 7.3.2, SQLAlchemy 2.0.40, Zustand 5.0+  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with existing Request/User/Package models  
**Testing**: pytest (backend), Vitest + Storybook (frontend), MSW (API mocking), axe-core (accessibility)  
**Target Platform**: Linux containers (Docker), modern web browsers  
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend architecture)  
**Performance Goals**: Handle 100MB file uploads, support concurrent users with queuing, fast Vite builds  
**Constraints**: 100MB file size limit, single upload per user, ADFS authentication required, WCAG AA compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise users, package-lock.json processing pipeline, component library with Storybook

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Security-First Architecture
- [x] All components designed with security as primary concern (ADFS auth, input validation)
- [x] Input validation and sanitization planned (JSON validation, file size limits)
- [x] Authentication and authorization requirements defined (ADFS integration)
- [x] No security shortcuts or "fix later" approaches (existing auth service)
- [x] Vulnerability management strategy included (existing Trivy integration)

### Production-Ready Development
- [x] No dummy services or hardcoded test data in production code (existing architecture)
- [x] All services containerized and configurable via environment variables (existing Docker setup)
- [x] Mock containers used for development only (mock-idp, mock-npm-registry)

**Structure Decision**: Enhanced web application structure with React 19.1.1, Node.js 20.x LTS, Vite, Storybook, MSW, and Zustand. The feature extends existing package upload functionality with enhanced validation, authentication, component testing, API mocking, and automated accessibility testing.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
