# Feature Specification: Package Lock Upload

**Feature Branch**: `001-package-lock-upload`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "package lock upload."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: What should be the maximum file size limit for package-lock.json uploads? ‚Üí A: 100 MB maximum file size (worst case scenario)
- Q: How should the system handle multiple simultaneous uploads from the same user? ‚Üí A: Allow only 1 upload at a time per user (queue others)
- Q: When a user's authentication token expires during the upload process, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Complete current upload but require re-authentication for next upload
- Q: For invalid file uploads, how specific should the error messages be? ‚Üí A: Specific technical errors (e.g., "Invalid lockfileVersion: expected 3+, got 2")
- Q: When the database is unavailable during upload, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Show error message and require user to retry manually

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I need to be able to login to a system securely (using ADFS) from a web interface, upload a package-lock.json file, and have the system store the package-lock request, requestor, and the raw file for processing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is not authenticated, **When** they attempt to access the package upload page, **Then** they should be redirected to the login page
2. **Given** a user is authenticated via ADFS, **When** they navigate to the package upload page, **Then** they should see the upload interface
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they upload a valid package-lock.json file, **Then** the system should store the request with their user information and the raw file content
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they upload an invalid file (not JSON or not package-lock.json), **Then** the system should display an appropriate error message
5. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they successfully upload a package-lock.json file, **Then** they should receive confirmation and be able to track the request status

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user uploads a corrupted or malformed JSON file?
- How does the system handle very large package-lock.json files? (Maximum 100 MB file size limit)
- What happens if the user's authentication expires during the upload process? (Complete current upload but require re-authentication for next upload)
- How does the system handle concurrent uploads from the same user? (Allow only 1 upload at a time per user, queue others)
- What happens if the database is unavailable during upload? (Show error message and require user to retry manually)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST require user authentication via ADFS before allowing package-lock.json uploads
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that uploaded files are valid JSON format
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that uploaded JSON files contain required package-lock.json fields (lockfileVersion, packages, etc.)
- **FR-004**: System MUST store the complete raw package-lock.json file content for each upload request
- **FR-005**: System MUST associate each upload request with the authenticated user who submitted it
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide specific technical error messages for invalid file uploads (e.g., "Invalid lockfileVersion: expected 3+, got 2")
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide confirmation feedback when uploads are successful
- **FR-008**: System MUST support file upload through a web interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST track upload progress and display it to the user
- **FR-010**: System MUST complete current upload if authentication token expires during process, but require re-authentication for next upload
- **FR-011**: System MUST log all upload activities for audit purposes
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate file size limits (maximum 100 MB per file)
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow only one concurrent upload per user (queue additional upload attempts)
- **FR-017**: System MUST show error message and require manual retry when database is unavailable during upload
- **FR-013**: System MUST support only package-lock.json files (lockfileVersion 3+) as specified in existing parsing rules
- **FR-014**: System MUST store request metadata including application name, version, and timestamp
- **FR-015**: System MUST be fully containerized and configurable via environment variables
- **FR-018**: System MUST use latest stable versions of all dependencies (React 19.1.1, Node.js 20.x LTS, Python 3.11+)
- **FR-019**: System MUST follow PEP8 standards with Black formatting and flake8 linting for Python code
- **FR-020**: System MUST use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript code formatting
- **FR-021**: System MUST include Storybook stories for all UI components
- **FR-022**: System MUST pass automated accessibility testing with axe-core (WCAG AA compliance)
- **FR-023**: System MUST use Zustand for global state management
- **FR-024**: System MUST use MSW for API mocking in development and tests

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Package Lock Request**: Represents a user's upload of a package-lock.json file, containing the raw file content, requestor information, application details, and processing status
- **User**: Represents an authenticated user who can upload package-lock.json files, with role-based permissions and audit trail
- **Raw File Content**: The complete, unprocessed package-lock.json file content stored as a blob for processing and reference
