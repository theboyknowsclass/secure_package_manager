# TODO - Secure Package Manager

## What's Missing

### 🔄 Parallel Processing
**Priority**: Medium  
**Issue**: Worker processes packages sequentially within each cycle  
**Solution**: Implement true parallel processing within worker cycles

**Details**:
- Currently processes packages one-by-one in each cycle
- Could process multiple packages simultaneously using threading/async
- Would significantly improve throughput for large uploads

---

### 📊 Advanced Monitoring
**Priority**: Low  
**Issue**: Basic monitoring via API, no metrics/alerting  
**Solution**: Add Prometheus metrics and alerting system

**Details**:
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Alerting for processing failures
- Performance dashboards

---

### 🎨 UI Integration
**Priority**: Low  
**Issue**: Frontend doesn't show real-time processing status  
**Solution**: Add real-time status updates to frontend

**Details**:
- Live progress bars for package processing
- Real-time processing status dashboard
- Admin panel for monitoring worker status
- Retry failed packages UI

---

### 🧪 Testing
**Priority**: Low  
**Issue**: Limited test coverage for edge cases  
**Solution**: Add comprehensive test suite for error scenarios

---

### 📚 Documentation
**Priority**: Low  
**Issue**: Limited documentation for deployment and operations  
**Solution**: Create comprehensive deployment and operations guide

## What's Working ✅

- ✅ Background worker service with database-based queue
- ✅ Automatic resume from database state on restart
- ✅ Real-time processing status via API endpoints
- ✅ Manual retry capabilities for failed packages
- ✅ Stuck package detection and recovery
- ✅ Trivy scan fixes for scoped packages
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and monitoring
