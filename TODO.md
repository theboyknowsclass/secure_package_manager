# TODO - Secure Package Manager

## What's Missing

### ðŸ”„ Parallel Processing
**Priority**: Medium  
**Issue**: Worker processes packages sequentially within each cycle  
**Solution**: Implement true parallel processing within worker cycles

**Details**:
- Currently processes packages one-by-one in each cycle
- Could process multiple packages simultaneously using threading/async
- Would significantly improve throughput for large uploads

---

### ðŸ“Š Advanced Monitoring
**Priority**: Low  
**Issue**: Basic monitoring via API, no metrics/alerting  
**Solution**: Add Prometheus metrics and alerting system

**Details**:
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Alerting for processing failures
- Performance dashboards

---

### ðŸŽ¨ UI Integration
**Priority**: Low  
**Issue**: Frontend doesn't show real-time processing status  
**Solution**: Add real-time status updates to frontend

**Details**:
- Live progress bars for package processing
- Real-time processing status dashboard
- Admin panel for monitoring worker status
- Retry failed packages UI

---

### ðŸ§ª Testing
**Priority**: Low  
**Issue**: Limited test coverage for edge cases  
**Solution**: Add comprehensive test suite for error scenarios

---

### ðŸ“š Documentation
**Priority**: Low  
**Issue**: Limited documentation for deployment and operations  
**Solution**: Create comprehensive deployment and operations guide

## What's Working âœ…

- âœ… Background worker service with database-based queue
- âœ… Automatic resume from database state on restart
- âœ… Real-time processing status via API endpoints
- âœ… Manual retry capabilities for failed packages
- âœ… Stuck package detection and recovery
- âœ… Trivy scan fixes for scoped packages
- âœ… Comprehensive logging and monitoring
