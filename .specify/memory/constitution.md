# Secure Package Manager Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every component MUST be designed with security as the primary concern. All code, configurations, and deployments MUST follow security best practices from day one. No security shortcuts or "we'll fix it later" approaches are acceptable. This includes input validation, authentication, authorization, data encryption, secure communication, and vulnerability management.

### II. Production-Ready Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST be production-ready from the first commit. No dummy services, hardcoded test data, or development-only code in production paths. Use mock containers for development (mock-idp, mock-npm-registry) but ensure code works in production with only configuration changes. All services MUST be containerized and configurable via environment variables.

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. All features MUST have comprehensive test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and security tests. No code goes to production without passing all tests.

### IV. SOLID and DRY Principles
Code MUST follow SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) where possible. Complex code MUST be justified with clear documentation of why simpler alternatives were insufficient.

### V. Container-First Architecture
All components MUST be fully dockerized with multi-environment support (dev/prod). No local development dependencies outside containers. Use Docker Compose for orchestration with proper separation of concerns and environment-specific configurations.

### VI. Accessibility and UX Standards
User interfaces MUST use commonplace UI libraries with minimal custom code. All interfaces MUST meet WCAG AA accessibility standards. Focus on usability, responsive design, and inclusive user experience. No custom UI components without strong justification.

## Security Requirements

### Authentication and Authorization
- ADFS integration for production authentication
- Role-based access control (user, approver, admin)
- JWT token management with proper expiration
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- All API endpoints MUST be protected

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries
- XSS protection in all user-facing interfaces
- Audit logging for all security-relevant actions

### Vulnerability Management
- Trivy integration for container and dependency scanning
- Regular security updates and dependency management
- No known vulnerabilities in production dependencies
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Production Readiness Standards

### Performance and Scalability
- Background worker architecture for processing
- Batch processing for performance optimization
- Database connection pooling and optimization
- Resource limits and monitoring in production
- Graceful degradation under load

### Monitoring and Observability
- Comprehensive logging with structured format
- Health check endpoints for all services
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Audit trail for all operations

### Deployment and Operations
- Zero-downtime deployment capability
- Environment-specific configurations
- Database migration strategy (init scripts approach)
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Disaster recovery planning

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Contract tests for service interfaces
- Security tests for authentication and authorization
- Performance tests for critical paths
- End-to-end tests for user workflows

### Code Quality
- Automated linting and formatting
- Code review requirements for all changes
- Static analysis and security scanning
- Documentation requirements for complex logic
- Performance profiling for optimization

### Documentation Standards
- All documentation MUST reflect the CURRENT state
- NO historical information or change logs in documentation
- README files describe what the system does NOW
- Inline code comments explain current functionality
- Remove outdated documentation immediately when making changes

## Development Workflow

### Git and Version Control
- Feature branch workflow with pull requests
- Meaningful commit messages with conventional format
- No direct commits to main branch
- Automated testing on all pull requests
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Environment Management
- Clear separation between development and production
- Mock services for development (mock-idp, mock-npm-registry)
- Environment-specific Docker configurations
- No production secrets in development code
- Configuration via environment variables only

### Service Management
- Use PowerShell scripts (.ps1) on Windows and shell scripts (.sh) on *nix
- Default to using scripts for starting, stopping, and managing services
- Scripts handle both development and production environments
- No manual Docker commands in production

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and MUST be followed by all team members. Amendments require:
- Documentation of the change and rationale
- Approval from project maintainers
- Migration plan for existing code
- Update to all dependent templates and documentation

All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with this constitution. Complexity MUST be justified with clear documentation. Use the project README and documentation for runtime development guidance.
