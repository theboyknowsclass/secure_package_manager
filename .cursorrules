# Cursor Rules for Secure Package Manager

## Production-Ready Development
This is a production system. All code must be production-ready from day one:
- No dummy services or hardcoded test data in production code
- Use mock containers for development (mock-idp, mock-npm-registry)
- Code should work in production with only configuration changes
- All services must be containerized and configurable via environment variables

## No Database Migrations
- We do NOT use database migrations
- Database schema is managed through init scripts in `database/` directory
- Schema changes are applied by updating init scripts and recreating containers
- This rule can be removed when we implement proper migrations for production release

## Documentation Standards
- All documentation must reflect the CURRENT state of the application
- NO historical information, change logs, or refactor records in documentation
- README files should only describe what the system does NOW
- Inline code comments should explain current functionality, not past changes
- Remove outdated documentation immediately when making changes

## Docker Service Management
- This is a dockerized application with service management scripts in `scripts/` folder
- Use PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`) on Windows and shell scripts (`.sh`) on *nix systems
- Default to using these scripts for starting, stopping, and managing services
- the dev-start and dev-stop both take an optional parameter for a specific container
- Scripts handle both development and production environments via docker-compose configurations
